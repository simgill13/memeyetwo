<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The main focus of the Spanish Repetiton Project was to help people learn one of the most popular and beautiful languages on the planet. By using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Space Repetiton</a> technique to teach Spanish, users are able to learn at a much more efficient pace.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<h3>Sign into Google</h3>
<p>Whether you are looking to pick up useful new skill or to impress a special person, Spanish Repetition is going to help you get the results you are seeking. By asking questions in an intuitive way, users will see questions that they get wrong more frequently than questions they get right. This way you can focus on learning what you don't know and not what you already do know.</p>
